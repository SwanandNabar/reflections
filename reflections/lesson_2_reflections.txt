What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When we initialize a repo we can see all the un commited files which can be committed to that repo. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

staging area has the files temporary stored to be commited. it is great to combine similar files which can be committed together.
